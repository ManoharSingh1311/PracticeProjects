Description:
This project is a simple Speech-To-Text (STT) Converter web application that allows users to convert spoken words into text in real-time. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this application leverages the Web Speech API to provide speech recognition capabilities directly in the browser.

Features:

    1.Speech Recognition: Utilizes the Web Speech API to recognize and transcribe spoken words into text.
    2.Real-Time Updates: Displays transcribed text in real-time as the user speaks.
    3.User-Friendly Interface: Provides a clean and intuitive user interface with a textarea for displaying 
        the transcribed text and a button for starting and stopping the speech recognition.
    4.Responsive Design: Ensures a consistent user experience across different devices with responsive design 
    principles.
    5.Error Handling: Alerts users if they attempt to start recording without enabling microphone
     access or if there are any errors during speech recognition.
    6.Cross-Browser Compatibility: Supports modern web browsers with built-in support for the SpeechRecognition API, 
    falling back to deprecated APIs for compatibility with older versions of Chrome.

    2.Speak into your device's microphone, and your spoken words will appear in the textarea in real-time.
